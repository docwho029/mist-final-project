    -------(17/12/2025, post midnight, so 18/12/2025)--------- <br>
    - finished individual product page <br>
    - decided against making cart feature, would be too similar to faves. <br>
    - todo : lazy loading, hamburger menu <br>
    - listening to imaginal disk rn. goated. <br>
    - took break yday, saw frankenstein (dir. del toro) and one battle after another (pta, dicaprio). both super well made films. obaa was super tight, middle section was my fave. really well put together movie. politics a little obvious, but not a problem. as for frankenstein, did the movie humanise the monster too much? detracts from book in the movie's recalcitrance in showing the monster's predisposition towards petty violence (which is arguably a very human quality?). would've loved to have seen a morally greyer version - visuals are stunning and overall very good watch. <br>

    - did not notice time go by, highkey sleep deprived. fml. will be pissed if this doesnt induce lynchian dreams. <br>
    - finished data-id system and favourites popup. faves uses localStorage. <br>
    todo : individual pages, cart page, lazy loading <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    ------(14/12/2025, post midnight, so 15/12/2025)------ <br>
    - done with popup frontend, search functionality done. fully responsive. <br>
    - began with adding data-id attributes for product ID system, in case i want to add individual product page(popups) as well. <br>
    - for cart system, product-id system is probably the way to go. we'll see how that goes. cheers. <br>
    - finished s1 of twin peaks, and twin, the show is peak. heard the 2nd season is super surrealist. agent cooper probably didnt die, hopefully its not something like "half the 2nd ssn is cooper dreaming in a near-languid state". love you david lynch. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    todo: <br>
    - cart system + product ID system <br>
    - individual pages for products <br>
    - side nav (hamburger menu) <br>
    - maybe add lazy loading? <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    ------(13/12/2025, sometime post midnight, so really 14/12/2025)------ <br>
