    ------(14/12/2025, post midnight, so 15/12/2025)------ <br>
    - done with popup frontend, search functionality done. fully responsive. <br>
    - began with adding data-id attributes for product ID system, in case i want to add individual product page(popups) as well. <br>
    - for cart system, product-id system is probably the way to go. we'll see how that goes. cheers. <br>
    - finished s1 of twin peaks, and twin, the show is peak. heard the 2nd season is super surrealist. agent cooper probably didnt die, hopefully its not something like "half the 2nd ssn is cooper dreaming in a near-languid state". love you david lynch. <br>
